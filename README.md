# python-guessing-game
I'll be creating a python program that will allow you to enter a number between 1 and 100. The machine will give you hints as to whether you are hot or cold and will allow you to make attempts until you win. I'm choosing this as a little project of mine because I want to learn more about loops and see them in action.
